docker is a tool for running applications in an isolated enviroment
docker will run the same in any machine since docker images contain OS,CODE,SOFTWARE needed 
for a container to run its application in an isolated state.

dockers has containers 
containers are standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software(such as
code and all dependencies)including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.
They are isolated from the host system and from other containers, ensuring that the software runs consistently
across different environments.(multiple containers can run on the same machine using all resource to maxium potential)
doesnt require a full OS within a container rather shares hosts OS and runs in isolation of other containers

dockers also has images
Docker image is a pre-built package(template) for creating an enviorment of your choice that contains all the files, libraries, 
and dependencies needed to run a (application) piece of software. It is the executable package that runs in a Docker container.
An image is built from a set of instructions called a Dockerfile, which defines how the image should be constructed 
and what it should include. OS SOFTWARE APP CODE

Containers are a running instance of an image
