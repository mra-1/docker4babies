docker ignore file allows you to ignore files that you dont want in your image

to have a working .dockerignore file you need to make the .dockerignore in the directory
that holds your image dependencies, the dockerignore file will make sure that the specifed files and folders
are not copied on to your new image.

within the .dockerignore you will specify folders and files that your docker image doesnt need.
